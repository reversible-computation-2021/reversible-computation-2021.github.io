          <h2>‪Kenichi Morita: How can we construct reversible Turing machines in a very simple reversible cellular automaton?</h2>
<p>
  Kenichi Morita is a professor emeritus of Hiroshima University, Japan.  
  He received his PhD degree from Osaka University in 1978.  
  From 1974 to 1987, he was a research associate of the Faculty of Engineering Science, Osaka University.  
  From 1987 to 1990, he was an associate professor, and from 1990 to 1993 a full professor of the Faculty of Engineering, Yamagata University.  
  From 1993 to 2013, he was a full professor of the Graduate School of Engineering, Hiroshima University. 
</p>
<p>
  Prof. Morita has been engaged in the research of automata theory, cellular automata, formal language theory, and reversible computing.  
  He started the study of reversible computing in the mid-1980s.  Since then, he studied many kinds of reversible computing models such as 
  reversible Turing machines, reversible counter machines, reversible cellular automata, reversible logic elements, and others.  
  In particular, he investigated the problem of how simple computationally universal reversible systems can be from the standpoint of automata theory.  
  He proposed the framework of partitioned cellular automata for designing reversible cellular automata.  
  Using this framework, he proved that a one-dimensional reversible cellular automaton is computationally universal.  
  He also proposed reversible logic elements with memory as alternatives to reversible logic gates, and clarified their universality and usefulness.

<h2>Shin-ichi Minato:‪ Decision Diagrams and Reversible Computation</h2>

<p>
Shin-ichi Minato is a Professor at Graduate School of Informatics,
Kyoto University. He received the B.E., M.E., and D.E. degrees from
Kyoto University in 1988, 1990, and 1995, respectively. He worked for
NTT Laboratories from 1990 until 2004. He was a Visiting Scholar at
Stanford University in 1997. He joined Hokkaido University as an
Associate Professor in 2004, and had been a Professor since 2010.
 From 2018, he is a Professor at Kyoto University (present position).
</p>

<p>
Prof. Minato's research interests include efficient representations and
manipulation algorithms for large-scale discrete structures, such as
Boolean functions, sets of combinations, sequences, permutations, etc.
He proposed the data structure "ZDD," which is minutely written as
an independent topic in the Knuth's book. From 2020, he started
a nation-wide research project "AFSA: Algorithmic Foundations for Social
Advancement" as the project leader.  He is a senior member of
IEEE, IPSJ and IEICE, and is a member of JSAI, and JSCS.

<h2>Atsushi Matsuo: Variational Quantum Eigensolver and Applications to Specific Optimization Problems</h2>
<p>
Atsushi Matsuo is a researcher at IBM Research - Tokyo. He received his B.E. and M.E. degrees in
Information Science and Engineering from Ritsumeikan University, Japan
in 2011 and 2013, respectively. He is currently a PhD student of
Graduate School of Information Science and Engineering, Ritsumeikan
University while working at IBM Research - Tokyo. His research
interests include quantum circuit synthesis, compilers for quantum
circuits and quantum algorithms for current noisy devices such as
variational quantum algorithms. Also, he works on developing quantum
community and develop quantum human resource for future. For example,
he participated Qiskit camps and hackathon as a coach. He contributed
to IBM Quantum Challenge that is a competitive programming contest for
quantum computers as one of core members.

<p>
  Perdita Stevens is Professor of Mathematics of Software Engineering in the
  School of Informatics of the University of Edinburgh.  After obtaining a PhD
  in algebra under Professor J. A. Green at the University of Warwick, she
  switched to professional software engineering, working for three years at
  BT's Glasgow Software and Systems Engineering Centre. Here she became
  interested in modelling of object oriented design, and in the relationship
  between mathematics and software engineering.  After returning to academia,
  her research interests have spanned model checking, legacy systems
  reengineering and games for software design; a common thread is that she
  likes identifying structure in systems and how it changes. From 2000-2006,
  she held an EPSRC Advanced Research Fellowship on Supporting Software
  Design.
</p>
<p>
  Prof. Stevens has been instrumental in the development of the bidirectional transformations community, helping organise the first Bidirectional Transformations Dagstuhl and cochairing the Bx 2013 workshop at ETAPS; she was the founding chair of the Bx steering committee. Her 2007 paper Bidirectional model transformations in QVT: Semantic issues and open questions was given the 10-year Most Influential Paper Award at MODELS 2017.

<h2>Marek Perkowski: Towards a systematic method to create quantum Grover oracles</h2>

<p>
  Marek Perkowski is a full professor and director of Intelligent Robotics
  Laboratory at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at
  Portland State University. He worked for Cypress Semiconductor (co-author of
  WARP, the first FPGA compiler of VHDL), Intel Supercomputer, Sharp
  Microelectronics, GTE and other companies in areas of computer architecture,
  CAD tools for logic synthesis and image processing.
</p>
<p>
  Dr. Perkowski invented Kronecker Decision Diagrams and lattices and
  contributed to logic synthesis software that is used in US industry. In 1994
  he worked for Machine Learning group in Wright Laboratories of U.S. Air
  Force applying logic decomposition as a machine learning approach to pattern
  recognition and continued this work on several grants.  He is an author of
  more than 507 publications in CAD, logic synthesis, multiple-valued logic,
  machine learning, robotics and quantum computing. His main research area is
  quantum computing – how to build a new generations of computers based on
  principles of quantum mechanics. These computers will be significantly more
  powerful than all contemporary standard computers.
