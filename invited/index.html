<!--<h2>Perdita Stevens: Problems and Prospects for Bidirectional Transformations</h2>

<p>
  Perdita Stevens is Professor of Mathematics of Software Engineering in the
  School of Informatics of the University of Edinburgh.  After obtaining a PhD
  in algebra under Professor J. A. Green at the University of Warwick, she
  switched to professional software engineering, working for three years at
  BT's Glasgow Software and Systems Engineering Centre. Here she became
  interested in modelling of object oriented design, and in the relationship
  between mathematics and software engineering.  After returning to academia,
  her research interests have spanned model checking, legacy systems
  reengineering and games for software design; a common thread is that she
  likes identifying structure in systems and how it changes. From 2000-2006,
  she held an EPSRC Advanced Research Fellowship on Supporting Software
  Design.
</p>
<p>
  Prof. Stevens has been instrumental in the development of the bidirectional transformations community, helping organise the first Bidirectional Transformations Dagstuhl and cochairing the Bx 2013 workshop at ETAPS; she was the founding chair of the Bx steering committee. Her 2007 paper Bidirectional model transformations in QVT: Semantic issues and open questions was given the 10-year Most Influential Paper Award at MODELS 2017.

<h2>Marek Perkowski: Towards a systematic method to create quantum Grover oracles</h2>

<p>
  Marek Perkowski is a full professor and director of Intelligent Robotics
  Laboratory at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at
  Portland State University. He worked for Cypress Semiconductor (co-author of
  WARP, the first FPGA compiler of VHDL), Intel Supercomputer, Sharp
  Microelectronics, GTE and other companies in areas of computer architecture,
  CAD tools for logic synthesis and image processing.
</p>
<p>
  Dr. Perkowski invented Kronecker Decision Diagrams and lattices and
  contributed to logic synthesis software that is used in US industry. In 1994
  he worked for Machine Learning group in Wright Laboratories of U.S. Air
  Force applying logic decomposition as a machine learning approach to pattern
  recognition and continued this work on several grants.  He is an author of
  more than 507 publications in CAD, logic synthesis, multiple-valued logic,
  machine learning, robotics and quantum computing. His main research area is
  quantum computing â€“ how to build a new generations of computers based on
  principles of quantum mechanics. These computers will be significantly more
  powerful than all contemporary standard computers.
