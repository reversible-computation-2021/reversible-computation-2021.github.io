  <strong>
    Due to the current health situation and travel regulations in the world,
    RC2020 will be held online.  Accepted papers will be published as planned.

<p>
  The Conference on Reversible Computation will bring together researchers from
  computer science, mathematics, engineering, and physics to discuss new
  developments and directions for future research in the emerging area of
  Reversible Computation. This particularly includes applications of
  reversibility in quantum computation. Research papers, tool demonstrations,
  and work-in-progress reports are within the scope of the conference.
</p>
<p>
All accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings and published by Springer as a Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) volume.
