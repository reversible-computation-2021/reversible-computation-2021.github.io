To test changes locally, make sure you have `ruby` and the `bundler` ruby gem installed (if you have `ruby` installed, you can run `gem install bundler` to install bundle). Then, navigate to the top directory of this repository. run `bundle exec jekyll serve`, and go to http://localhost:4000.

To make changes to individual files, just edit the `index.html` files. To make changes to common parts, e.g. the menu, edit `_layouts/default.html`. Some common parameters are housed in `_config.yml`, providing a convenient way of changing the conference edition, date, location and imagery each year.
